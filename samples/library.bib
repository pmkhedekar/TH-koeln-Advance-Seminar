   abstract = {Due to the proliferation of ICT during the last few decades, there is an exponential increase in the usage of various smart applications such as smart farming, smart healthcare, supply-chain logistics, business, tourism and hospitality, energy management etc. However, for all the aforementioned applications, security and privacy are major concerns keeping in view of the usage of the open channel, i.e., Internet for data transfer. Although many security solutions and standards have been proposed over the years to enhance the security levels of aforementioned smart applications, but the existing solutions are either based upon the centralized architecture (having single point of failure) or having high computation and communication costs. Moreover, most of the existing security solutions have focussed only on few aspects and fail to address scalability, robustness, data storage, network latency, auditability, immutability, and traceability. To handle the aforementioned issues, blockchain technology can be one of the solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we present a systematic review of various blockchain-based solutions and their applicability in various Industry 4.0-based applications. Our contributions in this paper are in four fold. Firstly, we explored the current state-of-the-art solutions in the blockchain technology for the smart applications. Then, we illustrated the reference architecture used for the blockchain applicability in various Industry 4.0 applications. Then, merits and demerits of the traditional security solutions are also discussed in comparison to their countermeasures. Finally, we provided a comparison of existing blockchain-based security solutions using various parameters to provide deep insights to the readers about its applicability in various applications.},

   abstract = {We investigate the effect of corporate sustainability on organizational processes and performance. Using a matched sample of 180 U.S. companies, we find that corporations that voluntarily adopted sustainability policies by 1993 - termed as high sustainability companies - exhibit by 2009 distinct organizational processes compared to a matched sample of companies that adopted almost none of these policies - termed as low sustainability companies. The boards of directors of high sustainability companies are more likely to be formally responsible for sustainability, and top executive compensation incentives are more likely to be a function of sustainability metrics. High sustainability companies are more likely to have established processes for stakeholder engagement, to be more long-term oriented, and to exhibit higher measurement and disclosure of nonfinancial information. Finally, high sustainability companies significantly outperform their counterparts over the long term, both in terms of stock market and accounting performance.},

   abstract = {Social sustainability is a major concern in global supply chains for protecting workers from exploitation and for providing a safe working environment. Although there are stipulated standards to govern supply chain social sustainability, it is not uncommon to hear of businesses being reported for noncompliance issues. Even reputable firms such as Unilever have been criticized for production labor exploitation. Consumers now increasingly expect sellers to disclose information on social sustainability, but sellers are confronted with the challenge of traceability in their multi-tier global supply chains. Blockchain offers a promising future to achieve instant traceability in supply chain social sustainability. This study develops a system architecture that integrates the use of blockchain, internet-of-things (IoT) and big data analytics to allow sellers to monitor their supply chain social sustainability efficiently and effectively. System implementation cost and potential challenges are analyzed before the research is concluded.},

   abstract = {The two environmental management system (EMS) standards EMAS and ISO 14001 have been available in Europe for the last 15 years. ISO 14001 has been taken up at a much larger scale but many firms in the German automotive and engineering industry have certified their EMSs according to both standards. Two research questions are addressed: (i) What explains why companies adopt both EMAS and ISO 14001? (ii) Are EMAS and ISO 14001 complements or substitutes? Based on 21 interviews with industrial and institutional representatives, this study finds that, first, the two standards are adopted for completely different reasons: while ISO 14001 is often done as a response to external pressure, EMAS tends to be motivated internally. Second, it is argued that EMAS and ISO 14001 are likely in a situation of direct competition at present which may well turn into complementarity in the future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim is to investigate the current state of blockchain technology and its applications in several specific characteristics of this disruptive technology can revolutionise “business-as-usual” practices. To this end, the theoretical underpinnings of numerous research papers published in high ranked scientific journals during the last decade, along with several reports from grey literature as a means of streamlining our assessment and capturing the continuously expanding blockchain domain, are included in this review. Based on a structured, systematic review and thematic content analysis of the discovered literature, we present a comprehensive classification of blockchain-enabled applications across diverse sectors such as supply chain, business, healthcare, IoT, privacy, and data management, and we establish key themes, trends and emerging areas for research. We also point to the shortcomings identified in the relevant literature, particularly limitations the blockchain technology presents and how these limitations spawn across different sectors and industries. Building on these findings, we identify various research gaps and future exploratory directions that are anticipated to be of significant value both for academics and practitioners.},

   abstract = {Industry 4.0 mainly refers to factories in which machines use smart and autonomous systems enhanced by the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning and cyber-physical systems. But what reveals the true potential of Industry 4.0 is the established connection and communication between computers and machines that allow making decisions without any human intervention. The network formed by these interconnected machines, and the generated considerable amount of data, marks the actual value of Industry 4.0. Looking at the main features of Industry 4.0, we find many similarities with blockchain technology. The key drivers for Industry 4.0 and blockchain are data management, connectivity and digitization. Additionally, decentralization and distribution are considered as shared architectural features. This paper seeks to open new horizons on the potential of blockchain technology as an empowering tool for the 4th industrial era. We are first investigating the fundamentals of Industry 4.0, its challenges, barriers and limitations, and finally exploring areas where blockchain technology can bring new features and add value to the deployment of Industry 4.0.},

   abstract = {Traceability can be referred to as the ability to track and trace information. Application of traceability can create transparency in supply chains. Conventionally available, centralized traceability solutions are not preferable for supply chains as they are exposed to many problems such as data manipulations, single point of failure, etc. Blockchain, the recently emerged distributed ledger technology, is gaining popularity with its tremendous applications in various fields, particularly in supply chain management. Technically, blockchain is a decentralized and distributed database where information can be securely recorded. Blockchain-based traceability solutions can tackle the shortcomings of centralized traceability solutions. Firms have already started incorporating blockchain into their supply chain activities in order to improve the transparency through tracking and tracing the events. This paper ultimately aims to present an overview of the various blockchain-based traceability solutions reported in the literature. Primarily, this work provides an insight on the possibilities of blockchain traceability solutions in making a supply chain transparent. Apart from this, it analyses how blockchain traceability solutions affect the visibility of various supply chain distribution network designs, and gives an outline on how technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), and smart contracts elevate the opportunities of blockchain. In order to demonstrate how blockchain traceability solutions improve supply chain transparency, a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a cold chain scenario is presented using Microsoft Azure Blockchain Workbench.},

In this study, a database from an independent ratings agency is used to examine, longitudinally, how Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) 300 firms are responding to ESG issues. Following institutional theory predictions, ASX300 firms are improving ESG performance over the 2002-2009 timeframe. Furthermore, over this timeframe, performance on the governance dimension improved at a greater rate than environmental or social performance, as predicted. Lastly, high impact industries are predicted to demonstrate overall improved ESG performance relative to medium or low impact industries over the timeframe, but this hypothesis was not confirmed.

   abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development of embedded technology has given rise to mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems to outsource sensing tasks to the public crowd equipped with various mobile devices. Sensing data often involves the workers' privacy, but overprotection of workers' data leads to the decrease of the data accuracy. Therefore, a crucial issue in such systems is how to balance workers' data privacy and data aggregation accuracy. The local differential privacy guarantees the data privacy by returning the privacy budget to workers. However, existing works only considered the workers' reputation as the weight of the aggregation result, but did not correlate with the rewards that workers deserve, which restrained workers' incentive of participation. Different from these works, by quantifying workers' reputation, we propose IM-LDP, an incentive mechanism for MCS based on local differential privacy, which includes four mechanisms of incentive, reputation, data perturbation and data aggregation. Specifically, incentive mechanisms are able to select workers who can provide more accurate data and compensate themselves for their privacy costs. The reputation mechanism quantifies the workers' reputation to improve their payments. The data perturbation mechanism ensures the tradeoff between the data privacy and aggregation accuracy, and the data aggregation mechanism generates highly accurate aggregation results. We evaluate the proposed IM-LDP through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments.},

   abstract = {Extended producer responsibility (EPR) of waste tires is usually implemented by a producer responsibility organizations (PRO) composed of a group of tire producers. As a collective EPR system, the main goals of PRO are to achieve recycling cost efficiency as well as offer incentives for all member producers to design their products for recyclability (or called eco-design). Nevertheless, current PROs for tire recycling are far from their goals and do not provide sufficient incentives because they ignore the differentiated recyclability of products from different producers and charge producers a uniform unit fee. To resolve these problems, we first create a mixed recovery decision model for tire recycling of PROs based on multi-choice goal programming (MCGP) approach towards system optimality and obtain the optimal total recovery cost. In particular, the proposed MCGP model allows for integrating a variety of different regulations under a carbon-policy regime into a single programming model through the formulated utility functions and penalty functions. This makes it easy to adjust the regulatory intensity to compromise the conflicting objectives regarding cost efficiency and carbon emission reduction. Further, recognizing the optimal total recovery cost as a baseline, a cost-sharing scheme is proposed to maintain the voluntary participation of producers for PRO as well as offer eco-design incentives for producers. This study proves that the solutions of the proposed hybrid method is more suitable for the research problem than the eminent solutions such as the Shapley value. The feasibility of the proposed hybrid model is examined via a numerical study with calibrated real-world datasets.},

   abstract = {The environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data provided in firms’ sustainability reports is often unaudited. If ESG information disclosed by firms is not reliable, a firm's greenwashing behavior can be a barrier to integrating ESG factors into investment decisions. In this paper, we study mechanisms to lessen firms’ greenwashing behavior in ESG dimensions holistically. Firstly, we identify “greenwashers” as firms which seem very transparent and reveal large quantities of ESG data but perform poorly in ESG aspects. By creating peer-relative greenwashing scores for a cross-country dataset comprised by 1925 large-cap firms, we measure the extent to which large-cap firms engage in greenwashing. We find evidence that greenwashing behavior in ESG dimensions can be deterred by scrutiny from (a) independent directors, (b) institutional investors, (c) influential public interests via a less corrupted country system, and (d) being cross-listed. Our results suggest that the two firm-level governance factors are most effective at attenuating firms’ misleading disclosure relating to ESG dimensions.},
